title: "The Letter G"
description: "Do you know the letter G?"
---

[A study at John Hopkins Universtiy](https://www.creativebloq.com/news/typography-quiz-reveals-gaps-in-letter-knowledge) tested whether or not people recognize the letter G. Interestingly enough I guessed which one was the correct G, but I am not entirely sure if this was based off of my knowledge prior to taking a typography course or if my typography course has made me more aware of letters and their identifiable shapes.
