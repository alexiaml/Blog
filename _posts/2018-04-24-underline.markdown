description: Make Links Readable

I have always found the use of underlines for links to be helpful because sometimes I cannot tell the difference between a header and body text or a link that is similiar in weight to the body text, but has no distinguishing features that tell you it is a link. [This article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/underlined-text-improve-ux/) explains how and when to use underlined text on the web.
