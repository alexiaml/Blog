description: Gearing Marketing Efforts Towards Household Latina Moms

I clicked on [this article](http://gdusa.com/blog/latina-moms-run-the-household)  based on the title alone because I was curious to see if the design and marketing strategies were using any stereotypes in their assessment of whatever trends they notice. While there are references to data, I cannot help but wonder if marketing schemes like this are only used to take advantage of something I as a latina, know to be kind of true.
