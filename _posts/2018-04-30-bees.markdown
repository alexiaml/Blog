title: "A Patent For Bees?"
description: Walmart Files Patent For Pollinating Drones
---

As described by [this article](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/03/20/walmart-patent-autonomous-robot-bees-pollinating-drones/) Walmart seeks to file a patent for pollinating drones which are essentially the design of bees and do what bees do. Can Walmart really place a patent on such technology considering the very nautre of it? If only the world did not have a hand in killing the bees, then perhaps these drones would not even need to be concieved.
