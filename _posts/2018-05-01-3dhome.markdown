[This article](https://www.dezeen.com/2018/04/20/cls-architetti-arup-use-portable-robot-3d-print-house-milan/) is about the use of a portable robot to create a rather cheap 3D printed home. The use of such technology on a wider scale could probe to be useful for communities that live in poor conditions and might not even have a "home". One concern is: how durable these materials are. How long will the homes actually last? Will they stand the test of time? The design seems rather simple.
