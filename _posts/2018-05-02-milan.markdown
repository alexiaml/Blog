While some of the designs from the design show in Milan are show in [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/style/where-is-design-going.html) some of them do not seem very practical or are not suitable for mass production. As far as designer items might go, these designs might exist within a more exclusive sphere rather than a more public one.
